## 📌 What It Does

Most job seekers send the same resume to every job. Companies use **ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)** that automatically reject resumes missing specific keywords — before a human ever reads them.

Resume Studio solves this by:

1. **Reading your existing resume** — it never invents experience you don't have
2. **Analyzing the job description** — extracting required skills, keywords, and tone
3. **Rewriting your resume** — reordering bullets, strengthening language, injecting ATS keywords naturally
4. **Writing a cover letter** — personalized to the role, in your voice, not generic templates
5. **Scoring the match** — shows % job fit, ATS score, strengths, gaps, and missing keywords

## 🧠 How the AI Works

This project uses **3 parallel AI calls** via the Groq API (openai/gpt-oss-20b):

```
User Resume + Job Description
          │
    ┌─────┴──────┐
    │            │            │
    ▼            ▼            ▼
Rewrite      Write        Score &
Resume      Cover        Analyze
(Prompt 1)  Letter       Match
            (Prompt 2)   (Prompt 3)
    │            │            │
    └─────┬──────┘
          ▼
   Results Screen
   (resume + cover letter + score)
```

All 3 calls run with `Promise.all()` — in parallel — so the total wait time is ~10–15 seconds instead of 30–45 seconds if run sequentially.

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

| Prompt | Role | Key technique |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Resume rewrite | Expert resume writer | Explicit rules: never invent, use STAR method, ATS keywords |
| Cover letter | Career coach | Anti-cliché rules, 3-paragraph structure, tone matching |
| Match analysis | Hiring manager | JSON-only output, structured scoring rubric |

## ⚙️ Architecture & Key Decisions

### Why Groq instead of OpenAI?
Groq provides a **free tier** with 14,400 requests/day and extremely fast inference (~500 tokens/sec vs OpenAI's ~50). For a portfolio project this means zero cost and a better user experience with faster responses.

### Why 3 separate prompts instead of 1?
Each task (resume rewrite, cover letter, scoring) has different instructions, output format, and quality requirements. Combining them into one prompt reduces quality significantly — the model context gets confused. Separate prompts + `Promise.all()` gives better results at the same speed.

### Why store PDF text in React state instead of a database?
This is a stateless, session-based app — no user accounts, no persistence needed. The PDF text lives in `useState()` and is sent with each API request. This keeps the architecture simple and avoids GDPR/data privacy concerns since nothing is stored server-side.

### Why Vite proxy instead of direct backend URL?
In development, the Vite proxy forwards `/api/*` to `localhost:4000`, eliminating CORS issues. In production, the frontend uses the live backend URL via an environment variable. This pattern means zero CORS configuration changes between dev and production.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "text": "John Doe\nSoftware Engineer...",
  "pages": 2,
  "filename": "my-resume.pdf"
}
```

---

### `POST /api/analyze`
Sends resume + job description to AI and returns all outputs.

**Request:** `application/json`
```json
{
  "resumeText": "extracted resume text...",
  "jobDescription": "We are looking for a Senior...",
  "userName": "John Doe"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "optimizedResume": "rewritten resume text...",
  "coverLetter": "personalized cover letter...",
  "matchScore": 78,
  "atsScore": 82,
  "verdict": "Strong match — React and Node.js experience aligns well",

  "gaps": ["No TypeScript listed", "No CI/CD experience"],
  "missingKeywords": ["TypeScript", "CI/CD", "AWS"]
}
```

## 🏃 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Free Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Paste your GROQ_API_KEY into .env
npm run dev
# Running on http://localhost:4000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Running on http://localhost:5175
```

### Test the API is working
Open: `http://localhost:4000/api/test-groq`  
You should see a JSON response with `"success": true` and an AI-generated message.

## 🗓 How It Was Built — 6-Day Learning Journey

This project was built as a **learning project** to understand Generative AI and LLM integration from scratch.

| Day | Focus | What was learned |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Backend setup + first AI call | How LLM APIs work, tokens, system prompts, Groq SDK |
| 2 | PDF upload & extraction | File handling with multer, binary-to-text with pdf-parse |
| 3 | AI analysis route | Prompt engineering, parallel API calls, JSON parsing from LLM output |
| 4 | React frontend | 4-step UI flow, state management, fetch with FormData |
| 5 | Polish & UX | Toast notifications, download feature, keyword highlighting, mobile responsive |
| 6 | Deploy & README | Vercel, Render, environment variables, documentation |

**Starting point:** No prior experience with Generative AI or LLMs  
**Ending point:** Full-stack AI-powered product, deployed and live

---

## 💡 What I Learned About LLMs

- **Tokens** are not words — they're chunks of ~4 characters. `max_tokens` controls output length.
- **System prompts** are the "job description" for the AI — they define its role and rules.
- **Temperature** controls randomness — lower = more consistent, higher = more creative.
- **Prompt engineering** matters enormously — the same task with different instructions gives wildly different quality outputs.
- **Parallel AI calls** with `Promise.all()` is a common pattern to reduce latency when tasks are independent.
- **JSON output from LLMs** requires defensive parsing — models sometimes add markdown around JSON that needs stripping.
- **Context window** = the maximum text (input + output) the model can handle in one call.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Export resume as formatted PDF (not just plain text)
- [ ] Multiple resume versions saved in localStorage
- [ ] LinkedIn profile URL as input (scrape + analyze)
- [ ] Interview question generator based on the job description
- [ ] Side-by-side diff view of original vs optimized resume
- [ ] Multi-language support (French, German, Spanish)
- [ ] User accounts + history with Supabase
